In these video we go through the algorithm to create BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) from Binary with the double dabble method. We then show a verilog example of how to code the Double Dabble algorithm! BCD is a very important number coding in order to drive things like 7 segment LED displays and more. This code will eventually be uploaded to an FPGA board to drive a set of 7 segment displays. The code can be downloaded from my GitHub link below.In the second video we build a simulation for the decimal to binary coded decimal converter that we made in the previous video. We start by making a quick design to show that it doesn't matter what you have designed when you make a simulation. We then go through the steps and code used to make the simulation. Finally we run the simulation and show a few tips on how to get around and view things. Enjoy the video and find the links to the code and the previous video below! Please keep an eye out in the description for the upcoming videos that tie into this project! Have a great day and don't forget to #LoveWell!!
