In this video we go through the algorithm to create BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) from Binary with the double dabble method. We then show a verilog example of how to code the Double Dabble algorithm! BCD is a very important number coding in order to drive things like 7 segment LED displays and more. This code will eventually be uploaded to an FPGA board to drive a set of 7 segment displays. The code can be downloaded from my GitHub link below. Please keep an eye out in the description for the upcoming videos that tie into this project! Have a great day and don't forget to #LoveWell!!</p>
